By 2026, projections suggest that the market will grow to USD 95 billion, while in 2027 the expected valuation will hit USD 100 billion. The continued influx of technology in fleet management, such as telematics and real-time tracking, will also augment the appeal of leasing arrangements, thus driving further growth.</p> <p>Looking ahead, the commercial truck leasing market is forecasted to achieve significant milestones, with estimates indicating a size of USD 110 billion by 2028. Moving towards 2030, projections suggest an expansion to USD 125 billion, continuing to reflect a robust annual growth rate.
